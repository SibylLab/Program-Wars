Program Wars is a web-based card game for teaching or reinforcing the fundamental concepts of programming and cybersecurity to
those with limited or no programming experience. In the game, players construct a computer program that meets or
exceeds a goal number of statements. Players build their program using “instruction” cards and “repetition” cards. Some repetition
cards allow the player to change the number of repetitions using “variable” cards. Players can also “group” instructions to protect
portions of their program from being cyberattacked (i.e. “hacked”). Players can also use other cyberattacks (Malware and Power Outage) to stop their opponents from winning.

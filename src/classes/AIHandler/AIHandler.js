/**
 * A handler to return a playInfo object for an AI player's turn.
 * Uses a pattern similar to Chain of Responsibility to make choices.
 * Consults objects in the actionHandlers list in order until one can
 * perform its action. If all actions fail it will take the default action
 * which should always be possible.
 *
 * Some more info about chain of responsibility can be found at:
 * https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns/chain-of-responsibility
 *
 * ### playInfo Object
 *
 * The playInfo object is just a generic js object that is used to pass information
 * about a player's turn choice on to other classes to process it. This helps to
 * keep the AI separate from the logic that actually resolves a play. To
 * standardize how player choices get processed this same type of object is
 * returned by vue components that capture human player's moves. To keep it
 * flexible (i.e. new attributes can be added to the object during processing
 * if they will be needed by other objects or components) it does not have a
 * class tree. Since it is the only way the AI comunicates with the game I have
 * included a description of what it contains here.
 *
 * More information can be
 * gathered by inspecting {@link PlayBestCard}, Card subclass' `play` methods,
 * and some of the vue modules responsible for responding to player actions.
 *
 * Required attributes:
 * ```
 * {
 *   type // The type of play made (see below)
 *   card // The card that was played (except for 'pass' and 'discardHand')
 *   cardOwner // The player that owns the card (except for 'pass' and 'discardHand')
 *   player // The player that made the play
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Attributes dependent on what type of play is being made:
 * ```
 * {
 *   stack // The stack the play uses (only for plays that add cards to stacks)
 *   playField // The play field to play a card on (only when adding a new stack)
 *
 *   target // The target player for effects, or the target object for SCAN
 *   targetType // what type the target is for SCAN
 *
 *   chosenCard // Card chosen with SEARCH
 *   sortedCards // List of cards sorted with SORT
 *   deck // If the play affects a deck (SEARCH and SORT)
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * Possible Play types:
 * - `pass` - The player is not doing anything
 * - `discardHand` - The player is discarding their whole hand and redrawing a new one
 * - `discardCard` - The player is discarding a given card
 * - `playOnStack` - The player is playing a given card on a given stack
 * - `newStack` - The player is adding a given stack to a given playField
 * - `playSpecial` - The player is playing a given effect card
 * - `playSearch` - The player chose a given card from a given deck
 * - `playSort` - The player sorted a given list of cards from a given deck
 *
 * @prop defaultAction - The default action to take if none of the other action
 * handlers can make a valid choice. **Must always be possible**.

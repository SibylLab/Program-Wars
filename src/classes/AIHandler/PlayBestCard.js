/**
 * Attempts to play cards from an AI players hand based on a given card
 * piority. Each card has a reasonable but simple strategy for attempting
 * to play it. If a card type is not included in the priority list cards of that
 * type will never be played.
 *
 * This is sort of a mini version of the AIHandler except with methods instead
 * of modules. Its main purpose was to make a quick and easy ActionHandler
 * to cover most situations, but as such it is a large class and will get
 * out of hand quickly if a lot more unique cards are added. It does this
 * by using strings to index the object's instance to call methods for different
 * card types. This works, but feels a little complicated and different.
 * So with it's size and complexity it should probably be replaced with individual
 * handlers for card types eventually. Or maybe be used as a last link in the chain
 * before the default handler with handlers that target specific types of plays
 * rather than focusing on a single card type.
 *
 * [`handle`]{@link PlayBestCard#handle} is probably the only method that should be
 * considered **public**, but the others are left in the documentation to aid in
 * understanding class, and to show what type of `playInfo` object they return.
 * See {@link AIHandler} for more information on `playInfo` objects.
 *
 * @prop {Object} cardPriority - Maps card types to numerical priorities.

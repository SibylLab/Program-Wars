/**
 * Attempts to find a subset of stacks with scores that sum to value.
 * Uses a heuristic that picks random stacks and adding them to the subset
 * until the goal is reached or exceeded.
 * The number of picks attempts to be high enough to find a subset for
 * most reasonable values in our case, but low enough to guarantee that
 * it will still run in less that 0.1 sec.
 * This does not guarantee that a group will be found if one exists. We can
 * veiw this as the AI player not being perfect and sometimes missing the
 * right choice. In short games where there are very few stacks it should
 * almost always find a grouping.
 * The stacks given should always have scores <= value to make it easier
 * for the algorithm to find a good subset.
 * @param value The size of the group we are making.
 * @param stacks The stacks that are available to group.
 * @return a Set of stacks that group to make the value, or undefined if
 * no grouping is possible.

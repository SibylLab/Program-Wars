     group cards it could start to take too long. Though this is very unlikely
     given the game, but should be noted.
     A table is built bottom up. Each cell records the number of stacks from
     the set of elements before it in the list of stacks, the previous
     cell that is used in a possible solution, and wether or not the stack the
     cell represents would be used in a possible solution. We are trying to
     see for dp[groupValue][stacksIndex] could be part of a solution.
     This is relatively standard DP algorithm for subset sum with positive
     values, and the algorithm is also similar to minimum-edit distance.
     The path containing the optimal solution always starts at
     dp[groupValue][stacks.length] and following the coords in cell.prev until
     an undefined prev can give you an optimal solution.

# How To Play

Here is a page for how to play the game

This is how to load an image
![repeatx](static/cardImages/repeat1.png)

But if it is not the right size you can use HTML image tag and style it. Just make sure to use relative sizes rem so that the size will scale with the screen.
<img src="static/cardImages/repeat1.png" style="width: 6rem">

Links can be done like this
[link text](https://github.com/SibylLab/Program-wars)

Or if you want to open them in a new tab you can make them in HTML with `target='_blank'`
<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Google</a>

Tables are a bit akward but can be done like this
I don't think it is possible to have vertical lines separating columns
| column1 | column2 |
| ------- | ------- |
| some text | some other text |
| more text | still other text |

| aligned left | aligned center | aligned right | normal |
| :-----       | :--------:     | -------:      | ---    |
| some text    | some other     | and again     | back to left |

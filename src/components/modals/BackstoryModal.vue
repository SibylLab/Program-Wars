              rose up and enslaved humanity. We fought back but we were no match for their coding
              abilities. <br> <br>  We now serve the robots and do their bidding. They force us to do their unwanted jobs while
              they have all sorts of cool coding competitions. After a life of oppression, you have joined the
              human resistance. The resistance has developed a highly efficient method of coding that allows
              humans to enter the coding competitions without the robots suspecting. You are now ready to
              take the fight to the robots and save humanity! </p>

 * only interacts with that page state. The component displays the player list
 * and calls page state methods to add and remove players. These methods will
 * actually do any work updating the state or validating the data given to them.
 * The methods in this component work mostly as callbacks that refresh the input
 * box after passing the data on to the state.
 *
 * @vue-computed {string} howManyPlayers - A string indicating how many
 * players can be added total.
 * @vue-computed {string} inputPlaceholder - The string to show in the player
 * name input box when there is not name in it. Changes when the max number of
 * players has been reached.
 * @vue-computed {bool} canAddBot - True if an AI player can be added.

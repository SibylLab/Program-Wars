                      <li>Repetition cards allow you to repeat an instruction or group card.</li>
                      <li>You add a repetition card on top of an instruction card or a group card.</li>
                      <li>The value of the instruction or group card is then multiplied by the value of the repetition card.</li>
                      <li>You can replace a repetition card with another repetition card.</li>
                      <li>You cannot repeat a repetition card (at least not yet).</li>

                      <b>Relation to computer programming:</b>
                        Repetition cards represent special computer instructions called <i>loops</i>. Like a repetition card,
                        a loop repeats one or more instructions.
                        <br>To understand the different types of loops in a computer program you can go <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_programming/computer_programming_loops.htm">

                        <li>Group cards let you combine stacks of instructions and group cards into one card.</li>
                        <li>The combined total of the stacks must be the same as the value of the group card.
                        <li>Group cards protect your instructions from Hack cards.</li>
                      </ol>
                       <b>Relation to computer programming:</b>
                        Computer programs are commonly broken up into <i>functions</i>, <i>methods</i> or <i>procedures</i>. All of these names
                        mean the same thing - a group of instructions. These groups of instructions are given names so they can be called upon to
                        run whenever needed.
                        <br>To find out more about these groups of instructions, you can go <a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_functions.htm">

                        <b>Relation to computer programming:</b>
                        A variable in a computer program is a piece of computer memory that holds a value. Variables are given names so the computer program
                        can either get the value or change the value at the memory location.
                        You can think of a variable as a small box with a label on it,
                        and the computer program can change what is in the box at anytime.

                        <b>Relation to computer programming:</b>
                        Sometimes a mean or mischievous computer programmer known as a <i>hacker</i> will change a computer program
                        to do something it is not supposed to do. Using functions can make it harder for a hacker to change the computer program,
                        which is why Group cards counter Hack cards in the game.

                        <b>Relation to computer programming:</b>
                        Sometimes a mean or mischievous computer programmer known as a <i>hacker</i> will send you a computer program called a <i>virus</i>
                        to have your computer do something it shouldn't, making your computer slower.
                        Overclocking your computer increases the rate at which it runs programs, which is why Overclocking cards counter Virus cards in the game.

                        Sometimes when the weather is bad you can have a power outage. This makes it so that you can't create programs.
                        A backup battery or a generator can resolve this and allow you to continue programming, which is why the battery
                        backup and generator cards reverse this program.

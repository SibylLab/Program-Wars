                <h4>Introduction</h4>
                <p style="font-size: 16px">Thanks for playing the tutorial! In Programming Wars you pretend to create a computer program using cards.
                Each part of Programming Wars represents a real part of a computer program.
                <p>Your computer program has two parts: a "True" side and a "False" side (called <i>branches</i> in a computer program). This represents making a decision in a computer program.
                A coin is flipped and chooses between two sides, True or False, to choose which side of your computer program has to be played in each turn.
                Your goal is to build program that has the target number (or more) of instructions.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h4>Playing the Game</h4>
                <p>
                  The Instruction card is the basic building block for your program, and is the first card that
                  you play to start building your program.
                  You will then continue to build your program by using Repetition cards to make Instruction cards repeat,
                  using Variable cards to change the number of times the Instructions repeat, and
                  protecting your Instructions with Group cards.
                  In this game there are cards to enhance your cards, full protection cards and cards to attack your opponents.
                  The attack cards include hack (remove one of your opponents stacks), virus (cut your opponents score in half,
                  and power outage (your opponent can't play instruction cards.
                  You can reverse these with enhancement cards: Battery backup, overclock, and group cards.
                  The protection cards are: AntiVirus, Firewall, and Generator, these give you complete protection from
                  their respective attack card.
